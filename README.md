# MinesweeperForGBA

Made Minesweeper for the GBA!

The controls are very easy. Start the game by choosing your settings with the D-pad. Then use the D-pad to move the cursor around. Press A to dig up a tile and B to flag a tile. The game will end when you clear all of the tiles or when you hit a bomb. Press start or A after the game ends to get a "You Win" or "You Lose", and press start or A again to go back to the menu.
